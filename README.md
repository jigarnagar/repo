This is the helping document to get the idea to execute the ADP assignment.

Prerequisite:

Below mentioned tools and technology has been used for reference:
1.	Core Java 1.6
2.	Apache Maven 3.0.1 
3.	IDE â€“ Eclipse Kepler 

I have created maven based project in my local environment and execute it successfully. I have also written the JUNIT TESTSUITE 
to verify project positive and negative scenario. Please find the below details to execute/update in project. 

Please refer the word document attached file for reference.

NOTE:

I am using the maven JAXB plugin that generates the java files. We have to manually copy the generate java file to src location 
[I used the maven copy command but it doesnot work for me] 

Target file [Copy]  - target\generated-sources\jaxb\com\adp\vehicleidentifier\jaxb
Copy those two java files (ObjectFactory.java, Vehicles.java) and paste it to 
SRC file [PASTE] - src\main\java\com\adp\vehicleidentifier\jaxb\
